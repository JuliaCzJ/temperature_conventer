# temperature_conventer
A simple program for converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.  

How it works
1. The program asks whether the temperature is in °C or °F.  
2. Based on your selection, it converts the temperature to the other unit.  
3. The result is rounded to one decimal place.

Example:
Is this temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit? (C/F): C
Enter the temperature: 100
Your temperature is 212.0 Fahrenheit

What I practiced:
- The `input()` function in Python
- Conditional statements `if/elif/else`
- Type conversion (`str` → `float`)
